    "# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON IN MATH 152\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your Computer Lab for MATH 152!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't taken MATH 151 here, you may be wondering, **\"Why a computer lab in a Calculus course?\"** There are several reasons discussed below. One\n",
    "major reason is that many of you are students in the College of Engineering and are learning (or will\n",
    "learn) Python in your ENGR 102 course. But several of you are NOT in the College of Engineering\n",
    "but will continue on in mathematics courses that require basic understanding of Python commands.\n",
    "This lab gives you an integrated curriculum; one whereby you apply techniques of Python\n",
    "programming to help solve basic mathematics problems. Generally, these computer labs will contain\n",
    "three types of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problems which allow you to learn basic Python commands\n",
    "2. Problems which allow you to solve mathematics problems while eliminating the tedious algebraic and computational aspects usually done by hand.\n",
    "3. Problems which allow you to visualize some of the important principles of pre-Calculus to help improve conceptual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if I didn't take 151 here?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't panic**. We will spend the first two labs reviewing the basic commands of Python that were used in 151 and will be used in 152 (numerical calculations, substituting, symbolic manipulation,solving equations, and plotting graphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When's the first assignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, since labs will be done in teams, so we need to wait until add/drop is finished. For now, some important information about the Python interface we will be using, Google Colab, and basics about the Python programming language itself."
