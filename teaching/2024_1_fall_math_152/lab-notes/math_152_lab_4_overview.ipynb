        "Recall that the integral of a continuous function $f(x)$ on an interval $[a,b]$ is equal to the limit $$ \\int_a^b f(x)\\,\\mathrm dx = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^Nf(x_{i,N})\\Delta x_N $$ where $x_{i,N} := a + i\\Delta x_N$ and $\\Delta x_N := (b-a)/N$. Therefore, for large values of $N$, we expect that the sum on the right is a good approximation to the integral of $f$: $$ \\int_a^b f(x)\\,\\mathrm dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^Nf(x_{i,N})\\Delta x_N. $$ We will implement the sum on the right and use it to approximate the integral of $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ on $[0,2]$."
