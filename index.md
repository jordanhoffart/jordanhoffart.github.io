Howdy! I'm a 6th year math PhD student at Texas A&M University. My advisor is
[Dr. Matthias Maier](https://matthiasmaier.org/), and I'm currently working on
structure-preserving numerical methods for multi-physics systems. You can
contact me at [jordanhoffart@tamu.edu](mailto:jordanhoffart@tamu.edu).
